# Finding_URL_with_-Domains
Twitter is a free social networking site where users
broadcast short posts known as tweets. These
tweets can contain text, videos, photos,urls or
links. By default twitter compresses that full URL
into a short one and uploads it so that we can
easily use it. Our project will convert that
compressed URL into the orignal long one and
also find out its domain. This project is tottaly
based on Machine Learning Concepts. Some
datasets of twitter has also been used for this
project.
